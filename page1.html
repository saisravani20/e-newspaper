        <h1>China Urges Restraint As US Military Searches For Balloon Remnants</h1>
        <p>The U.S. MILITARY said on Sunday it was searching for remnants of the suspected Chinese surveillance balloon it shot down a day earlier, while Beijing urged Washington on Monday not to escalate the issue or take further action to harm its interests.

            The drama over the balloon, which Beijing again reiterated was a civilian airship that accidentally strayed into U.S. airspace, has further strained tense relations, prompting Washington to cancel a planned visit to Beijing by Secretary of State Antony Blinken.

            The U.S. Navy is working to recover the balloon and its payload and the Coast Guard is providing security for the operation, General Glen VanHerck, commander of the North American Aerospace Defense Command and U.S. Northern Command, said on Sunday.</p>
      
        <p>A successful recovery could potentially give the United States insight into China's spying capabilities, though U.S. officials have downplayed the balloon's impact on national security. A U.S. fighter jet shot down the balloon in the Atlantic off South Carolina on Saturday, a response China described as an "obvious overreaction".</p>

        <p>China has said the balloon, intended for meteorological and other scientific purposes, had accidentally blown off course. "China firmly opposes and strongly protests against this," Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng said in remarks to the U.S. embassy in Beijing posted on the ministry's website on Monday.

            "The Chinese government is closely following the development of the situation," he said. Later on Monday, 
            foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said China had found out its balloon had drifted over the United States after being notified by that country. She said another balloon, sighted in Latin America, was from China and intended for civilian purposes.
